        <h2>White Box</h2>
        <p>For my project, I wanted to use machine learning api to to detect and map facial features then duplicate/ swap detected subjects. 
          <br>Additionally, ideal output would be in the style of cubism. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>I used Jupyter Notebook and OpenCV (both are relatively new to me) 
          <br>I initially wrote a script just for camera testing w/ black & white filter.<br>
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/43915a8f-0813-432d-bd23-8805ec75833c/camTest.png?v=1683938221365" alt = "camTest">
        
        <br clear="all"><br>
        <p>I then played around with defining alll object outlines within camera for a canny edge effect.</p>

        <br clear="all"><br>
        <p>After that, facial recognition was implemented and was able to detect multiple faces.</p>

        <br clear="all"><br>
        <p>My initial test with replicating detected feature within in bounding boxes failed & resulted in multiplication of boxes but no duplicated detected features. </p>

        <br clear="all"><br>
        <p>After some reference look up & experimenting, I was able to duplicate detected facial features, but it is then that python started to repeatedly crash on me, most likely due to over complications with OpenCV :( </p>

        <br clear="all"><br>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I probably won't use OpenCV for similar future endeavors, will try ml5js using a combination of Facemesh & StyleTransfer. </p>
